## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](link-to-diagram)

The FinancePal Solo application consists of three main components:
1. **Frontend (React)**: A responsive and user-friendly interface for managing your finances.
2. **Backend (Flask)**: Handles API requests, user authentication, and transaction data processing.
3. **Database (MySQL)**: Stores user data, transaction history, and categorized reports.

The app uses the Plaid API to securely retrieve transaction data from users' bank accounts and stores that data in a MySQL database. The backend processes and categorizes transactions, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to track their spending.
